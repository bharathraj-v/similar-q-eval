015c4,"A river has width 0.5 km and flows from West to East with a speed 30 km/hr. If a boatman starts sailing boat at a speed 40 km/hr normal to bank, the boat shall cross the river in time -

The problem describes a river with a width of 0.5 km flowing from West to East at a speed of 30 km/hr. A boatman starts sailing a boat at a speed of 40 km/hr normal to the bank.",Physics,"1. **Identify the relevant quantities for crossing time:** The time it takes for the boat to cross the river is determined by the river's width and the component of the boat's velocity perpendicular to the river banks. The river's flow speed (30 km/hr) only affects the downstream displacement of the boat, not the time it takes to reach the opposite bank if the boat's velocity component across the river is considered independently.
2. **List the given values:**
    *   Width of the river (distance, d) = 0.5 km
    *   Speed of the boat normal to the bank (velocity component across the river, v_b) = 40 km/hr
3. **Apply the basic formula for time:** Time = Distance / Speed.
4. **Substitute the given values into the formula:** Time = 0.5 km / 40 km/hr.
5. **Calculate the result:** Time = 0.0125 hours.",0.0125 hours,6725,,"To determine the time it takes for the boat to cross the river, we consider the motion perpendicular to the river banks independently of the motion parallel to the banks. The width of the river is the distance that needs to be covered perpendicular to the banks, and the boat's speed normal to the bank is the velocity component directly contributing to crossing this distance. The river's flow speed only affects how far downstream the boat travels, not the time it takes to cover the width of the river when the boat is directed normal to the bank.

Given:
1.  Width of the river (distance, d) = 0.5 km
2.  Speed of the boat normal to the bank (velocity, v) = 40 km/hr

The formula to calculate time (t) is:
Time = Distance / Speed
t = d / v

Substitute the given values into the formula:
t = 0.5 km / 40 km/hr
t = 0.0125 hours

This approach aligns with the principle of relative velocity where perpendicular components of motion are independent. Unlike the similar questions where the boat might need to travel at an angle to compensate for the river's flow to achieve a direct path or where the river's speed is a factor in the effective crossing velocity, in this problem, the boat's velocity is already stated as 'normal to bank', simplifying the calculation to a direct application of time = distance/speed for the perpendicular motion.",0.0125 hours,13255,,100,100,"Both the 'sim_answer' and 'no_sim_answer' provide exceptionally accurate and complete solutions to the problem. They both correctly identify the fundamental principle that the time to cross the river is determined solely by the river's width and the component of the boat's velocity perpendicular to the banks. They correctly disregard the river's flow speed, as it only influences the downstream displacement and not the crossing time in this specific scenario where the boat is directed normal to the bank. Both explanations are clear, logically structured, and lead to the correct final answer of 0.0125 hours. There is no discernible difference in their quality or thoroughness; both are perfect solutions.",,2025-08-18 18:50:16

4.  **बाएं पक्ष का समाकलन करें:**
    $\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} dx$
    मान लें $u = 1+x^2$। तब $du = 2x dx$, जिसका अर्थ है $x dx = \frac{1}{2} du$।

5.  **दाएं पक्ष का समाकलन करें:**
    $\int -\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}} dy$
    मान लें $v = 1+y^2$। तब $dv = 2y dy$, जिसका अर्थ है $y dy = \frac{1}{2} dv$।

Each such value of k corresponds to a unique value of n that satisfies A^n = A within the given range.",25,22378,,"1.  **Given Matrix A:**
    $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1 \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$

2.  **Calculate $A^2$:**
    $A^2 = A \cdot A = \begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1 \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1 \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} (1+i)(1+i) + 1(-i) & (1+i)(1) + 1(0) \\ (-i)(1+i) + 0(-i) & (-i)(1) + 0(0) \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} (1+2i+i^2) - i & 1+i \\ (-i-i^2) & -i \end{pmatrix}$
    Since $i^2 = -1$:
    $A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} (1+2i-1) - i & 1+i \\ (-i-(-1)) & -i \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2i-i & 1+i \\ -i+1 & -i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} i & 1+i \\ 1-i & -i \end{pmatrix}$

3.  **Calculate $A^3$:**
    $A^3 = A^2 \cdot A = \begin{pmatrix} i & 1+i \\ 1-i & -i \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1 \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^3 = \begin{pmatrix} i(1+i) + (1+i)(-i) & i(1) + (1+i)(0) \\ (1-i)(1+i) + (-i)(-i) & (1-i)(1) + (-i)(0) \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^3 = \begin{pmatrix} (i+i^2) + (-i-i^2) & i \\ (1^2-i^2) + i^2 & 1-i \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^3 = \begin{pmatrix} (i-1) + (-i+1) & i \\ (1-(-1)) + (-1) & 1-i \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ (2) - 1 & 1-i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ 1 & 1-i \end{pmatrix}$

4.  **Calculate $A^4$:**
    $A^4 = A^3 \cdot A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ 1 & 1-i \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1 \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^4 = \begin{pmatrix} 0(1+i) + i(-i) & 0(1) + i(0) \\ 1(1+i) + (1-i)(-i) & 1(1) + (1-i)(0) \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^4 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 - i^2 & 0 \\ (1+i) + (-i+i^2) & 1 \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^4 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 - (-1) & 0 \\ (1+i) + (-i-1) & 1 \end{pmatrix}$
    $A^4 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$
    So, $A^4 = I$, where I is the identity matrix.

5.  **Determine the pattern for $A^n$:**
    Since $A^4 = I$, the powers of A repeat in a cycle of 4:
    $A^1 = A$
    $A^2 = A^2$
    $A^3 = A^3$
    $A^4 = I$
    $A^5 = A^4 \cdot A = I \cdot A = A$
    $A^6 = A^4 \cdot A^2 = I \cdot A^2 = A^2$
    In general, $A^n = A^{n \pmod 4}$ if $n \pmod 4 \neq 0$, and $A^n = I$ if $n \pmod 4 = 0$.
    More precisely, if $n = 4k+r$ where r is the remainder (0, 1, 2, or 3), then $A^n = A^{4k+r} = (A^4)^k \cdot A^r = I^k \cdot A^r = A^r$.
    If $r=0$, then $A^n = A^0 = I$. (Note: In this context, $A^0$ means $I$. If $n$ is a multiple of 4, say $n=4k$, then $A^{4k} = (A^4)^k = I^k = I$.)

6.  **Apply the condition $A^n = A$:**
    We need $A^n = A$. This happens when the exponent $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
    So, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 4$.
    This means $n$ can be written in the form $4k+1$ for some non-negative integer $k$.

7.  **Find the number of elements in the set {n \u2208 {1,2,......,100} : $A^n$ = A}:**
    We are looking for values of $n$ in the set \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} such that $n = 4k+1$.
    For $k=0$, $n = 4(0)+1 = 1$. ($1 \in \{1, \ldots, 100\}$)
    For $k=1$, $n = 4(1)+1 = 5$. ($5 \in \{1, \ldots, 100\}$)
    ...
    We need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that $n \le 100$:
    $4k+1 \le 100$
    $4k \le 99$
    $k \le \frac{99}{4}$
    $k \le 24.75$
    Since $k$ must be an integer, the maximum value for $k$ is 24.
    The possible values for $k$ are $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 24$.

8.  **Count the values:**
    The number of possible integer values for $k$ is $24 - 0 + 1 = 25$.
    Each value of $k$ corresponds to a unique value of $n$ in the given range.

Therefore, there are 25 elements in the set.
This solution approach is consistent with similar problems where powers of a matrix repeat in a cycle, often involving the identity matrix. The calculation of powers of A and finding $A^4 = I$ is crucial. Then, establishing the congruence relation for $n$ and counting the terms within the specified range completes the solution.",25,35917,,100,100,"Both the sim_answer and no_sim_answer provide a correct, accurate, and complete solution to the problem.

Finally, both solutions correctly count the number of such integers n within the range of 1 to 100, which is 25. The explanations are clear, step-by-step, and mathematically sound in both cases, leading to identical and correct final answers. There is no qualitative difference between the two solutions.",,2025-08-18 18:50:59
01a13,1.0 mol of Fe reacts completely with 0.65 mol of O₂ to give a mixture of only FeO and Fe₂O₃. The mole ratio of ferrous oxide to ferric oxide is,Chemistry,"Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1.  **Identify the chemical reactions:**
    We are forming two products, ferrous oxide (FeO) and ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃), from iron (Fe) and oxygen (O₂). Let's write the balanced chemical equations for their formation:
    *   For FeO: Fe + ½ O₂ → FeO  (Equation 1)
    *   For Fe₂O₃: 2Fe + 1.5 O₂ → Fe₂O₃ (Equation 2)

2.  **Define variables for moles of products:**
    Let 'x' be the moles of FeO produced.
    Let 'y' be the moles of Fe₂O₃ produced.

3.  **Set up equations based on stoichiometry and given quantities:**
    *   **Iron (Fe) consumed:** According to the problem, 1.0 mol of Fe reacts completely. From the balanced equations:
        *   Moles of Fe consumed to form FeO = x (from Equation 1: 1 mol Fe per 1 mol FeO)
        *   Moles of Fe consumed to form Fe₂O₃ = 2y (from Equation 2: 2 mol Fe per 1 mol Fe₂O₃)
        Total moles of Fe consumed = x + 2y
        Since 1.0 mol of Fe reacts completely: x + 2y = 1.0 mol (Equation A)

    *   **Oxygen (O₂) consumed:** We are given that 0.65 mol of O₂ reacts. From the balanced equations:
        *   Moles of O₂ consumed to form FeO = 0.5x (from Equation 1: 0.5 mol O₂ per 1 mol FeO)
        *   Moles of O₂ consumed to form Fe₂O₃ = 1.5y (from Equation 2: 1.5 mol O₂ per 1 mol Fe₂O₃)
        Total moles of O₂ consumed = 0.5x + 1.5y
        Since 0.65 mol of O₂ reacts: 0.5x + 1.5y = 0.65 mol (Equation B)

4.  **Solve the system of linear equations:**
    We have two equations with two unknowns:
    (A) x + 2y = 1.0
    (B) 0.5x + 1.5y = 0.65

    From Equation (A), express x in terms of y: x = 1.0 - 2y

    Substitute this expression for x into Equation (B):
    0.5(1.0 - 2y) + 1.5y = 0.65
    0.5 - y + 1.5y = 0.65
    0.5 + 0.5y = 0.65
    0.5y = 0.65 - 0.5
    0.5y = 0.15
    y = 0.15 / 0.5
    y = 0.30 mol

    Now substitute the value of y back into the expression for x:
    x = 1.0 - 2(0.30)
    x = 1.0 - 0.60
    x = 0.40 mol

5.  **Determine the mole ratio:**
    Moles of ferrous oxide (FeO) = x = 0.40 mol
    Moles of ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃) = y = 0.30 mol

    The mole ratio of ferrous oxide to ferric oxide is FeO : Fe₂O₃ = x : y = 0.40 : 0.30

    To simplify the ratio, divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (0.10):
    0.40 / 0.10 : 0.30 / 0.10 = 4 : 3

Therefore, the mole ratio of ferrous oxide to ferric oxide is 4:3.",4:3,19378,,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the conservation of mass for Fe and O₂.

First, write the balanced chemical equations for the formation of FeO and Fe₂O₃:
1.  For ferrous oxide (FeO): 2Fe + O₂ → 2FeO
2.  For ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃): 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

Let 'x' be the moles of FeO formed and 'y' be the moles of Fe₂O₃ formed.

From the balanced equations, we can determine the moles of Fe and O₂ required for 'x' moles of FeO and 'y' moles of Fe₂O₃:

For 'x' moles of FeO:
*   Moles of Fe needed = x moles (since 2 moles of Fe produce 2 moles of FeO, the ratio is 1:1)
*   Moles of O₂ needed = x/2 moles (since 1 mole of O₂ produces 2 moles of FeO, the ratio of O₂ to FeO is 1:2)

For 'y' moles of Fe₂O₃:
*   Moles of Fe needed = 2y moles (since 4 moles of Fe produce 2 moles of Fe₂O₃, the ratio of Fe to Fe₂O₃ is 2:1)
*   Moles of O₂ needed = 3y/2 moles (since 3 moles of O₂ produce 2 moles of Fe₂O₃, the ratio of O₂ to Fe₂O₃ is 3:2)

Now, set up two equations based on the total moles of Fe and O₂ consumed:

1.  **Total moles of Fe consumed:**
    Moles of Fe from FeO + Moles of Fe from Fe₂O₃ = Total Fe
    x + 2y = 1.0 mol  (Equation 1)

2.  **Total moles of O₂ consumed:**
    Moles of O₂ from FeO + Moles of O₂ from Fe₂O₃ = Total O₂
    x/2 + 3y/2 = 0.65 mol
    Multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear the denominators:
    x + 3y = 1.3 mol  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1.  x + 2y = 1.0
2.  x + 3y = 1.3

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to solve for 'y':
(x + 3y) - (x + 2y) = 1.3 - 1.0
 y = 0.3 mol

Substitute the value of 'y' (0.3 mol) back into Equation 1 to solve for 'x':
x + 2(0.3) = 1.0
x + 0.6 = 1.0
x = 1.0 - 0.6
x = 0.4 mol

So, moles of FeO (x) = 0.4 mol
Moles of Fe₂O₃ (y) = 0.3 mol

The mole ratio of ferrous oxide (FeO) to ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃) is x : y:
Ratio = 0.4 : 0.3
To express this as a whole number ratio, multiply both sides by 10:
Ratio = 4 : 3

This approach is robust for problems involving multiple product formation and conservation of reactants, similar to how mole ratios are used in the given similar questions to determine compound formulas, but extended to a system of equations for multiple products.",4:3,21072,,100,100,"Both answers provide a perfectly accurate and complete solution to the problem. The methodology used in both explanations is identical and correct: setting up a system of linear equations based on the conservation of mass for the reactants (Fe and O

The only minor difference is in the balancing of the initial chemical equations:

The image shows a mathematical expression involving a series. The expression starts with 'If y = 1 +', followed by a series of terms. The general form of each term in the series is a fraction where the numerator involves a product of 'x' terms with subscripts (e.g., x1, x2, x3) and powers of 'x', and the denominator involves a product of differences of the form '(x - xi)', where 'i' is an index. The series continues up to (n+1) terms. Following this series, there is an expression to prove, which involves the derivative of 'y' with respect to 'x' (dy/dx). This expression equates dy/dx to a product of 'y/x' and a sum of fractions. Each fraction in the sum has a numerator of the form 'xi' and a denominator of the form 'xi - x', where 'i' ranges from 1 to n.",Mathematics,"To prove the given derivative relationship, we first need to simplify the expression for \(y\). 

**Step 1: Simplify the expression for y**
Let's examine the first few terms of the series for \(y\):

\(T_0 = 1\)
\(T_1 = \frac{x_1}{x - x_1}\)
\(T_2 = \frac{x_2 \cdot x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\)
\(T_3 = \frac{x_3 \cdot x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}\)

The general term \(T_k\) for \(k \ge 1\) appears to be \(T_k = \frac{x_k \cdot x^{k-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)}\).

Let's sum the terms sequentially:

*   **Sum of the first 1 term (up to \(T_0\)):**
    \(S_0 = T_0 = 1\)

*   **Sum of the first 2 terms (up to \(T_1\)):**
    \(S_1 = T_0 + T_1 = 1 + \frac{x_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{(x - x_1) + x_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{x}{x - x_1}\)

*   **Sum of the first 3 terms (up to \(T_2\)):**
    \(S_2 = S_1 + T_2 = \frac{x}{x - x_1} + \frac{x_2 \cdot x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\)
    \(S_2 = \frac{x(x - x_2) + x_2 x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)} = \frac{x^2 - x x_2 + x x_2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)} = \frac{x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\)

We observe a pattern: \(S_k = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)}\).

We can prove this pattern by induction. Assume \(S_k = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)}\) holds. Then for \(S_{k+1}\):
\(S_{k+1} = S_k + T_{k+1} = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)} + \frac{x_{k+1} \cdot x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}(x - x_i)}\)
\(S_{k+1} = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)} \left( 1 + \frac{x_{k+1}}{x - x_{k+1}} \right)\)
\(S_{k+1} = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)} \left( \frac{x - x_{k+1} + x_{k+1}}{x - x_{k+1}} \right)\)
\(S_{k+1} = \frac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x - x_i)} \left( \frac{x}{x - x_{k+1}} \right)\)
\(S_{k+1} = \frac{x^{k+1}}{\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}(x - x_i)}\)

The pattern holds. Since the series for \(y\) has \((n+1)\) terms, it sums up to \(T_n\). Therefore,
\(y = S_n = \frac{x^n}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\dots(x - x_n)}\)

**Step 2: Differentiate \(y\) using logarithmic differentiation**
Take the natural logarithm of both sides of the simplified expression for \(y\):
\(\ln y = \ln \left( \frac{x^n}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\dots(x - x_n)} \right)\)
Using logarithm properties (\(\ln(A/B) = \ln A - \ln B\) and \(\ln(AB) = \ln A + \ln B\)):
\(\ln y = \ln(x^n) - \ln((x - x_1)(x - x_2)\dots(x - x_n))\)
\(\ln y = n \ln x - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln(x - x_i)\)

Now, differentiate both sides with respect to \(x\):
\(\frac{d}{dx}(\ln y) = \frac{d}{dx}(n \ln x) - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln(x - x_i)\right)\)
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = n \cdot \frac{1}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x - x_i}\)
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x - x_i}\)

**Step 3: Manipulate the derivative to match the required form**
The required form is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} \left[ \frac{x_1}{x_1 - x} + \frac{x_2}{x_2 - x} + \dots + \frac{x_n}{x_n - x} \right]\), which can be written as \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{x_i - x}\).

Let's transform our derived expression:
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x - x_i}\)
Since \(\frac{n}{x}\) can be written as a sum of \(n\) terms of \(\frac{1}{x}\):
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x - x_i}\)
Combine the sums:
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x - x_i} \right)\)
Find a common denominator for the terms inside the sum:
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{(x - x_i) - x}{x(x - x_i)} \right)\)
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{-x_i}{x(x - x_i)} \right)\)
Rewrite the denominator to match the target form \((x_i - x)\):
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i}{x(x_i - x)} \right)\)
Factor out \(\frac{1}{x}\) from the sum:
\(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{x_i - x}\)

Finally, multiply both sides by \(y\):
\(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} \left[ \frac{x_1}{x_1 - x} + \frac{x_2}{x_2 - x} + \dots + \frac{x_n}{x_n - x} \right]\)

This completes the proof.",The proof is provided in the explanation section.,39442,,"1.  **Simplify the series for y:** Observe the pattern in the given series for y. Let's denote the partial sums:
    *   For 1 term: y
_0_ = 1
    *   For 2 terms: y
_1_ = 1 + \(\frac{x_1}{x - x_1}\) = \(\frac{x - x_1 + x_1}{x - x_1}\) = \(\frac{x}{x - x_1}\)
    *   For 3 terms: y
_2_ = y
_1_ + \(\frac{x_2 x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\) = \(\frac{x}{x - x_1} + rac{x_2 x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\) = \(\frac{x(x - x_2) + x_2 x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\) = \(\frac{x^2 - x x_2 + x_2 x}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\) = \(\frac{x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}\)
    *   For 4 terms: y
_3_ = y
_2_ + \(\frac{x_3 x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}\) = \(\frac{x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)} + rac{x_3 x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}\) = \(\frac{x^2(x - x_3) + x_3 x^2}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}\) = \(\frac{x^3}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}\)
    This pattern suggests that for \((n+1)\) terms, the sum simplifies to:
    \(y = rac{x^n}{\prod_{i=1}^n (x - x_i)}\)
    This can be formally proven by induction. Assuming the sum up to \(k\) terms is \(\frac{x^{k-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} (x - x_i)}\), the sum up to \(k+1\) terms will be \(\frac{x^{k-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} (x - x_i)} + rac{x_k x^{k-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^k (x - x_i)} = rac{x^{k-1}(x - x_k) + x_k x^{k-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^k (x - x_i)} = rac{x^k}{\prod_{i=1}^k (x - x_i)}\). Thus, for \((n+1)\) terms, \(y = rac{x^n}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\%dots(x - x_n)}\).

2.  **Apply Logarithmic Differentiation:** Take the natural logarithm of both sides of the simplified expression for \(y\):
    \(\ln y = \ln rac{x^n}{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\%dots(x - x_n)}\)
    Using logarithm properties (\(\ln(A/B) = \ln A - \%ln B\) and \(\ln(AB) = \%ln A + \%ln B\) and \(\ln(A^k) = k \%ln A\) ):
    \(\ln y = n \ln x - \left[ \ln(x - x_1) + \ln(x - x_2) + \dots + \ln(x - x_n) \right]\)
    \(\ln y = n \ln x - \sum_{i=1}^n \ln (x - x_i)\)

3.  **Differentiate with respect to x:** Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\):
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} (n \ln x) - \frac{d}{dx} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \ln (x - x_i) \right)\)
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = n \cdot \frac{1}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x - x_i} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x - x_i)\)
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x - x_i}\)

4.  **Manipulate to match the desired form:** The target expression is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} \left[ \frac{x_1}{x_1 - x} + \frac{x_2}{x_2 - x} + \dots + \frac{x_n}{x_n - x} \right]\). This can be rewritten as:
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{x_i - x}\)
    Let's manipulate the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{x_i - x}\):
    Each term \(\frac{x_i}{x_i - x}\) can be written as \(\frac{x_i - x + x}{x_i - x} = 1 + \frac{x}{x_i - x}\).
    So, the sum becomes \(\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{x}{x_i - x}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x}{x_i - x}\)
    \(= n + x \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i - x}\)
    Substitute this back into the desired form for \(\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}\):
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \left[ n + x \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i - x} \right]\)
    \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x} + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i - x}\)
    This exactly matches the expression derived in step 3. Since \(\frac{1}{x_i - x} = -rac{1}{x - x_i}\), our derived equation \(\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x} - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x - x_i}\) is equivalent to \(\frac{n}{x} + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i - x}\).

Therefore, by multiplying both sides by \(y\), we obtain the desired result:
\(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} \left[ \frac{x_1}{x_1 - x} + \frac{x_2}{x_2 - x} + \dots + \frac{x_n}{x_n - x} \right]\)",\(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} \left[ \frac{x_1}{x_1 - x} + \frac{x_2}{x_2 - x} + \frac{x_3}{x_3 - x} + \dots + \frac{x_n}{x_n - x} \right]\),50266,,98,100,"Both answers provide excellent, complete, and accurate proofs for the given problem.Both explanations correctly identify the need to first simplify the series for y into a more compact form. They both correctly deduce the pattern y = x^n / (product from i=1 to n of (x - x_i)) and provide a rigorous proof by induction for this simplification. This is a crucial and well-executed step in both solutions.Following the simplification, both answers correctly employ logarithmic differentiation, which is the most efficient way to differentiate the complex product and quotient form of y. They both arrive at the intermediate result (1/y)(dy/dx) = n/x - (sum from i=1 to n of 1/(x - x_i)).The final step involves manipulating this derived expression to match the desired form (dy/dx) = (y/x) * [ (x_1)/(x_1 - x) + (x_2)/(x_2 - x) + ... + (x_n)/(x_n - x) ]. The sim_answer transforms the target expression's summation to show that it is equivalent to the derived expression. The no_sim_answer directly transforms the derived expression's summation to match the target expression's summation.Both methods of demonstrating equivalence are mathematically sound and clearly presented. The no_sim_answer's manipulation in the final step is perhaps marginally more direct as it transforms the derived equation into the target equation, step-by-step.The sim_answer contains minor rendering glitches with ""rac"" appearing instead of ""\frac"" in a few places, which doesn't affect the mathematical correctness but impacts readability slightly. The no_sim_answer is flawlessly formatted and equally clear in its reasoning.Therefore, no_sim_answer is slightly better due to perfect formatting and a very clear, direct manipulation in the final step.",,2025-08-18 18:51:35
