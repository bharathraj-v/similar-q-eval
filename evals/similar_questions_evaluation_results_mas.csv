The original equation is simplified by multiplying both sides by $\log(5x-4)$, which gives $2\log x = \log(5x-4)$. Using the power rule of logarithms, this simplifies to $\log x^2 = \log (5x-4)$. By equating the arguments, the equation becomes $x^2 = 5x - 4$, which is rearranged to $x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0$. This quadratic equation is factored into $(x-1)(x-4) = 0$, yielding potential solutions $x=1$ and $x=4$. The solutions are checked against the domain restrictions. $x=1$ is extraneous because it violates the condition $x \neq 1$. The solution $x=4$ satisfies the domain restrictions.
