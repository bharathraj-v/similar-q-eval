Let the center of circle C be (h, k). Since circle C touches the x-axis, its radius is |k|. The given circle has center (0, 1) and radius 1. Since the two circles touch each other externally, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. Thus,  sqrt((h-0)^2 + (k-1)^2) = |k| + 1. Squaring both sides gives h^2 + (k-1)^2 = (|k|+1)^2 which simplifies to h^2 + k^2 - 2k + 1 = k^2 + 2|k| + 1, and further simplifies to h^2 = 2k + 2|k|.  Now, if k > 0, then |k| = k, so h^2 = 2k + 2k = 4k, which means k = h^2/4. If k < 0, then |k| = -k, so h^2 = 2k - 2k = 0, which means h = 0.

        "summarized_solution_approach": "The effective thermal conductivity (Keq) of the system is calculated using the formula Keq = (K₁A₁ + K₂A₂) / (A₁ + A₂), where K₁ and K₂ are the thermal conductivities of the inner and outer cylinders, respectively, and A₁ and A₂ are their respective areas. The area of the inner cylinder (A₁) is πR², and the area of the outer cylindrical shell (A₂) is 3πR². Substituting these values into the formula and simplifying, the effective thermal conductivity of the system is found to be (K₁ + 3K₂)/4."
